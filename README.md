# Document-Search-Information-Retrieval-BM25
Document searching using best matching ranking BM25 for Final Project Information Retrieval
This project implements BM25 algorithm described in [this paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c0a4/8ed7577a7b48288dfb2711cbd86e30636b5f.pdf) for ranking documents according to relevance.

## Known issues
This implementation is best fit for small datasets because it lacks the inverted index required for fast querying in big datasets
